**Abstract**
Recently, there has been great interest in multi-touch interfaces.
Such devices have taken the form of camera-based systems such as
Microsoft Surface [de los Reyes et al. 2007] and Perceptive Pixel’s
FTIR display [Han 2005] as well as hand-held devices using capac-
itive sensors such as the Apple iPhone [Jobs et al. 2008]. However,
optical systems are inherently bulky while most capacitive systems
are only practical in small form factors and are limited in their ap-
plication since they respond only to human touch and are insensitive
to variations in pressure [Westerman 1999].
We have created the UnMousePad, a flexible and inexpensive multi-
touch input device based on a newly developed pressure-sensing
principle called Interpolating Force Sensitive Resistance. IFSR sen-
sors can acquire high-quality anti-aliased pressure images at high
frame rates. They can be paper-thin, flexible, and transparent and
can easily be scaled to fit on a portable device or to cover an en-
tire table, floor or wall. The UnMousePad can sense three orders
of magnitude of pressure variation, and can be used to distinguish
multiple fingertip touches while simultaneously tracking pens and
styli with a positional accuracy of 87 dpi, and can sense the pressure
distributions of objects placed on its surface.
In addition to supporting multi-touch interaction, IFSR is a general
pressure imaging technology that can be incorporated into shoes,
tennis racquets, hospital beds, factory assembly lines and many
other applications. The ability to measure high-quality pressure
images at low cost has the potential to dramatically improve the
way that people interact with machines and the way that machines
interact with the world.

**Abstract**
If some time ago textile materials were considered good sound insulators, their present programmability is about to
change their definition, transforming them into musical instruments and tools of sound measurement and
visualization. By comparison to the analogue world, the notions of texture and touch are gaining new connotations,
while the new textures and ‘smart gestures’ are introducing a new expressivity. Following a series of inquiries in
physical computing, the present text will present a series of new configurations between texture, touch and sound and
the connections between them in both analogue and digital environments. The paper will focus on a series of practice-
based research related to the integration of touch and sound sensors into textile structures, as well as on the
translation of sound components into dynamic textile patterns.
**Keywords:** Haptic, sound, sound sensors, touch sensors, dynamic textile patterns.
