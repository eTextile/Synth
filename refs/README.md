* #### The UnMousePad - An Interpolating Multi-Touch Force-Sensing Input Pad
##### Rosenberg, I., Perlin, K. 2009. The UnMousePad – An Interpolating Multi-Touch Force-Sensing Input Pad. ACM Trans. Graph. 28, 3, Article 65 (August 2009), 9 pages. DOI: 10.1145/1531326.1531371

**Abstract**  
Recently, there has been great interest in multi-touch interfaces.
Such devices have taken the form of camera-based systems such as
Microsoft Surface [de los Reyes et al. 2007] and Perceptive Pixel’s
FTIR display [Han 2005] as well as hand-held devices using capac-
itive sensors such as the Apple iPhone [Jobs et al. 2008]. However,
optical systems are inherently bulky while most capacitive systems
are only practical in small form factors and are limited in their ap-
plication since they respond only to human touch and are insensitive
to variations in pressure [Westerman 1999].  
We have created the UnMousePad, a flexible and inexpensive multi-
touch input device based on a newly developed pressure-sensing
principle called Interpolating Force Sensitive Resistance. IFSR sen-
sors can acquire high-quality anti-aliased pressure images at high
frame rates. They can be paper-thin, flexible, and transparent and
can easily be scaled to fit on a portable device or to cover an en-
tire table, floor or wall. The UnMousePad can sense three orders
of magnitude of pressure variation, and can be used to distinguish
multiple fingertip touches while simultaneously tracking pens and
styli with a positional accuracy of 87 dpi, and can sense the pressure
distributions of objects placed on its surface.  
In addition to supporting multi-touch interaction, IFSR is a general
pressure imaging technology that can be incorporated into shoes,
tennis racquets, hospital beds, factory assembly lines and many
other applications. The ability to measure high-quality pressure
images at low cost has the potential to dramatically improve the
way that people interact with machines and the way that machines
interact with the world.

##### Roh, Jung-Sim & Mann, Yotam & Freed, Adrian & Wessel, David. (2011). Robust and Reliable Fabric, Piezoresistive Multitouch Sensing Surfaces for Musical Controllers.

**Abstract**  
The design space of fabric multitouch surface interaction is

##### Heinzel, Tincuta. (2014). HAPTIC AND SOUND CORRELATIONS IN TEXTILES. Proceedings Ambience`14&10i3m, 7-9 Sept 2014 Tampere, Finland.

**Abstract**  
If some time ago textile materials were considered good sound insulators, their present programmability is about to
change their definition, transforming them into musical instruments and tools of sound measurement and
visualization. By comparison to the analogue world, the notions of texture and touch are gaining new connotations,
while the new textures and ‘smart gestures’ are introducing a new expressivity. Following a series of inquiries in
physical computing, the present text will present a series of new configurations between texture, touch and sound and
the connections between them in both analogue and digital environments. The paper will focus on a series of practice-
based research related to the integration of touch and sound sensors into textile structures, as well as on the
translation of sound components into dynamic textile patterns.

* #### Project Jacquard: Interactive Digital Textiles at Scale
##### Poupyrev, Ivan & Gong, Nan-Wei & Fukuhara, Shiho & Karagozler, Mustafa & Schwesig, Carsten & Robinson, Karen. (2016). Project Jacquard: Interactive Digital Textiles at Scale. 4216-4227. DOI: 10.1145/2858036.2858176. 

**Abstract**  
Project Jacquard presents manufacturing technologies that
enable deploying invisible ubiquitous interactivity at scale.
We propose novel interactive textile materials that can be
manufactured inexpensively using existing textile weaving
technology and equipment.  
The development of touch-sensitive textiles begins with the
design and engineering of a new highly conductive yarn.
The yarns and textiles can be produced by standard textile
manufacturing processes and can be dyed to any color,
made with a number of materials, and designed to a variety
of thicknesses and textures to be consistent with garment
designers’ needs.  
We describe the development of yarn, textiles, garments,
and user interactivity; we present the opportunities and
challenges of creating a manufacturable interactive textile
for wearable computing.

manufacturing, touch interaction_

* #### PolySense: Augmenting Textiles with Electrical Functionality using In-Situ Polymerization
##### Honnet, Cedric & Perner-Wilson, Hannah & Teyssier, Marc & Fruchard, Bruno & Steimle, Jürgen & Baptista, Ana & Strohmeier, Paul. (2020). PolySense: Augmenting Textiles with Electrical Functionality using In-Situ Polymerization. 1-13. DOI: 10.1145/3313831.3376841. 
**Abstract**  
We present a method for enabling arbitrary textiles to sense
pressure and deformation: In-situ polymerization supports
integration of piezoresistive properties at the material level,
preserving a textile’s haptic and mechanical characteristics.
We demonstrate how to enhance a wide set of fabrics and
yarns using only readily available tools. To further support
customisation by the designer, we present methods for pat-
terning, as needed to create circuits and sensors, and demon-
strate how to combine areas of different conductance in one
material. Technical evaluation results demonstrate the perfor-
mance of sensors created using our method is comparable to
off-the-shelf piezoresistive textiles. As application examples,
we demonstrate rapid manufacturing of on-body interfaces,
tie-dyed motion-capture clothing, and zippers that act as po-
tentiometers.
